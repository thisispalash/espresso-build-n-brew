The primary advantage of using rollup to deploy the project is that it provides an opportunity to customize the chain, and reduce costs for certain actions, along with limiting the use case of the chain to only app related activities, thereby reducing congestion.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed below is the master plan for the rollup. Not everything is necessarily implemented yet. Over the course of [the hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/build-and-brew), I was able to refine a few ideas and what I wanted to achieve with the project. Next steps are to continue development under the [Alchemy + Arbitrum grant](https://www.alchemy.com/arbitrum-grant).

## Support Vector Machines
> rudimentary sentiment analysis

## (Emotional) Precompiles
> taking expensive compute off chain

## Custom Gas Token
> aka, purpose driven rollup

## Testnet vs Mainnet

## Token Pricing
